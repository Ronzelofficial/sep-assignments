1. O(1) its constant
2. O(n) linear because it has to go through the whole data set,
3. O(n^2) quadratic because it loops through the data set twice while still only passing in one thing (array)
4. O(2^n) as n increases this will get exponentially slow
5. O(n)   linear, just iterating through a data set
6. O(nlog(n)) exponentially gets faster i think because of all the recursive calls, but im actually not sure.
